//TODO maybe a picture of the UI here?

* IDE-like environment for writing/compiling/running sketches
* Has own simple programming language
** Processing internally transforms and compile it as Java code
* Has also a Python mode

void settings() {
	//used if parameters used for size function
	size(CANVAS_WIDTH, CANVAS_HEIGHT, P2D );
}

}

void draw() {
	// loop, draw one frame
}
