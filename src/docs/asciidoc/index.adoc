== Presentation Navigation

* Navigate with arrows
* `*s*` open speaker notes
* `*b*` or `*.*` to blank screen
* `*esc*` to get slide overview

--
Some test notes
--

== Agenda

* Basics needed for a demo
* Processing
* Rocket
* Moonlander
* General tips

== Demo basics

[%step]
* Graphics
* Music
* Music usually in sync with image
* Last few minutes
* (These vary depending competition rules and categories)

== Processing
* https://processing.org/ "Processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts."
* Free & Open source
* Works on major PC platforms


=== Processing Basics
//TODO maybe a picture of the UI here?

* IDE-like environment for writing/compiling/running sketches
* Has own simple programming language
** Processing internally transforms and compile it as Java code
* Has also a Python mode

=== Sketch structure

[source, java]
----

//Global variables here

void settings() {
	//used if parameters used for size function
	size(CANVAS_WIDTH, CANVAS_HEIGHT, P2D );
}

void setup() {
	//one-time setup call at the start
}

void draw() {
	// loop, draw one frame
}
----

=== settings function
* New in Processing 3.x
* Used if using variables for the size() function parameters

=== setup function
* Called once per sketch before draw
* Used to initialize systems
** Setup fps, Moonlander etc. (explained later)

e.g.

[source, java]
----
void setup(){
	frameRate(60);
	
	...
}
----

=== draw function
* Called once per frame
** (if computer can handle)

e.g.

[source, java]
----
void draw(){
	... TODO
}
----


== Rocket

[%step]
* General problem: How to sync music into graphics?
** Solution: Make demo as a function of time and use a tracker
** -> Rocket


== Testing..

NOTE: a note
